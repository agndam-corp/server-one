# cert-manager Webhook for Spaceship DNS - Project Completion Summary

## Project Status

✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

The cert-manager webhook for Spaceship DNS has been successfully implemented, tested, and is now fully functional in production.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Functional Implementation
- ✅ Webhook correctly implements cert-manager DNS01 challenge solver interface
- ✅ Successfully authenticates with Spaceship DNS API using X-API-Key and X-API-Secret headers
- ✅ Properly formats requests for Spaceship DNS API (PUT method with force: true and items field)
- ✅ Creates and deletes TXT records as required for ACME DNS01 challenges

### 2. Kubernetes Integration
- ✅ Correctly registers as an extension API with Kubernetes (APIService)
- ✅ Properly configured RBAC permissions for both cert-manager and webhook service accounts
- ✅ Securely retrieves API credentials from Kubernetes secrets
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with ArgoCD for GitOps deployment

### 3. Production Ready
- ✅ Successfully issued certificate for `argocd.djasko.com`
- ✅ Certificate shows as READY=True with valid TLS secret created
- ✅ No errors in webhook or cert-manager logs
- ✅ All Kubernetes components functioning correctly

## Verification Results

```
$ kubectl get certificate -n argocd argocd-djasko-com
NAME                READY   SECRET                  AGE
argocd-djasko-com   True    argocd-djasko-com-tls   132m
```

## Technical Details

### Components Status

- ✅ ClusterIssuer ready and functional
- ✅ Spaceship API secret properly configured
- ✅ Certificate successfully issued and stored

### API Integration
- **Create Records**: `PUT /v1/dns/records/{domain}` with proper payload format
- **Delete Records**: `PUT /v1/dns/records/{domain}` with empty items array
- **Authentication**: `X-API-Key` and `X-API-Secret` headers
- **Request Format**: JSON payload with `force: true` and `items` field
