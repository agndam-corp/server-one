# cert-manager Webhook for Spaceship DNS - Project Completion Report

## Project Overview

This report summarizes the successful completion of the cert-manager webhook for Spaceship DNS project. The goal was to enable automated Let's Encrypt certificate issuance for domains managed by Spaceship DNS through integration with cert-manager.

## Objectives Achieved

### 1. Core Functionality
✅ Developed webhook implementing cert-manager DNS01 challenge solver interface
✅ Integrated with Spaceship DNS API for TXT record creation/deletion
✅ Implemented proper authentication with API key/secret headers
✅ Formatted requests according to Spaceship DNS API requirements

### 2. Kubernetes Integration
✅ Registered webhook as extension API with Kubernetes
✅ Configured proper RBAC permissions for cert-manager and webhook service accounts
✅ Secured API credentials through Kubernetes secrets
✅ Integrated with ArgoCD for GitOps deployment

### 3. Production Deployment
✅ Successfully issued certificate for `argocd.djasko.com`
✅ Certificate shows as `READY=True` with valid TLS secret created
✅ All components running without errors
✅ Integrated with existing infrastructure

### 4. Documentation & Maintenance
✅ Created comprehensive documentation covering all aspects
✅ Provided troubleshooting guides for common issues
✅ Documented all fixes made during development
✅ Created deployment checklists for future use

## Technical Implementation

### Components Status
- ✅ Webhook pod: `Running` with `READY 1/1`
- ✅ APIService: `AVAILABLE True`
- ✅ ClusterIssuer: `READY True`
- ✅ Certificate: `READY True`

### API Integration
- **Create Records**: `PUT /v1/dns/records/{domain}` with proper payload format
- **Delete Records**: `PUT /v1/dns/records/{domain}` with empty items array
- **Authentication**: `X-API-Key` and `X-API-Secret` headers
- **Request Format**: JSON payload with `force: true` and `items` field

### Technologies Used
- **Go**: 1.22
- **Kubernetes**: v1.33.4+k3s1
- **cert-manager**: v1.15.3
- **client-go**: v0.30.1

## Key Challenges Overcome

### 1. APIService Configuration
**Issue**: APIService showing as "Local" instead of pointing to webhook service
**Solution**: Fixed `versionPriority` (100→15) and added explicit port specification

### 2. RBAC Permissions
**Issue**: Multiple RBAC permission errors for both cert-manager and webhook
**Solution**: Added necessary ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings

### 3. Authentication & Request Format
**Issue**: Incorrect headers and request format for Spaceship DNS API
**Solution**: Updated to use `X-API-Key`/`X-API-Secret` headers, PUT method, and proper payload format

### 4. Kubernetes Version Compatibility
**Issue**: Flowcontrol-related errors due to deprecated API versions
**Solution**: Updated dependencies and removed deprecated permissions

## Verification Results

```
$ kubectl get certificate -n argocd argocd-djasko-com
NAME                READY   SECRET                  AGE
argocd-djasko-com   True    argocd-djasko-com-tls   132m
```

All verification checks passed:
✅ Webhook pod running correctly
✅ APIService available
✅ ClusterIssuer ready
✅ Certificate issued successfully
✅ No errors in logs

## Documentation Created

14 comprehensive documentation files created:
- Quick start guide
- Deployment guide
- Troubleshooting guide
- Deployment checklist
- Fix summaries for all issues
- Complete project completion summary

## Future Considerations

### Maintenance
- Regular credential rotation
- Certificate expiration monitoring
- Dependency updates with cert-manager releases
- Kubernetes version compatibility verification

### Enhancements
- Support for multiple domains/API credentials
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Automated testing suite
- Additional DNS providers

## Conclusion

The cert-manager webhook for Spaceship DNS project has been successfully completed. All objectives have been met, and the webhook is now fully functional in production, automatically issuing and managing Let's Encrypt certificates for domains managed by Spaceship DNS.

The implementation follows Kubernetes best practices for security, RBAC, and resource management, and provides comprehensive documentation for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting.

The webhook represents a robust, scalable solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing Kubernetes and cert-manager ecosystem, providing automated certificate management with minimal operational overhead.
