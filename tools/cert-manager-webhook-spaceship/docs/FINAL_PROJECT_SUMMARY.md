3. **Authentication** - Corrected API key/secret headers and request format
4. **Kubernetes Compatibility** - Updated dependencies and removed deprecated APIs

## Future Considerations

### Maintenance Tasks
1. Regular credential rotation for Spaceship API access
2. Monitoring for certificate expiration and renewal
3. Keeping dependencies updated with cert-manager releases
4. Verifying continued compatibility with Kubernetes upgrades

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. Support for multiple domains with different API credentials
2. Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities
3. Automated testing suite for regression prevention
4. Additional DNS providers beyond Spaceship DNS

## Conclusion

The cert-manager webhook for Spaceship DNS is now a production-ready solution that provides seamless, automated certificate management for domains hosted with Spaceship DNS. The implementation follows Kubernetes best practices and integrates smoothly with the existing infrastructure.

All project objectives have been met, and the webhook is successfully issuing certificates in production.
